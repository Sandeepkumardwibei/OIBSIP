<b>It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It will need a  display screen to display the user’s input and give the results. The grid system in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator. The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on.</b>
Project Description:

This project involves building a simple calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator should be able to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project will cover fundamental web development skills, including structuring a web page, styling it, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

<b>Objectives:</b>

Create an interactive calculator interface that mimics the functionality of a physical calculator.
Implement a display screen that dynamically shows the user's input and calculation results.
Design a button layout using CSS Grid to organize numbers and operators efficiently.
Key Features:

Display Screen: The calculator includes a display section to show inputs and outputs. It updates in real-time as the user interacts with the buttons.

Buttons for Digits and Operations: The calculator includes buttons for digits (0–9), basic operators (+, −, ×, ÷), an equal sign (=) for calculation, and a clear button (C) to reset the display.

Event Listeners: Event listeners capture button clicks and enable the calculator to process user inputs and display results.

Operations & Logic: Basic arithmetic operations are implemented using JavaScript. The program reads user input, performs calculations based on selected operations, and displays the results.

Error Handling: If the user tries to divide by zero or input invalid characters, appropriate error handling messages are displayed.

Styling with CSS: CSS is used to style the calculator. A grid layout helps arrange the buttons and ensures they are evenly aligned for a clean, intuitive interface.

Tools Used:

HTML: For structuring the calculator’s display and buttons.
CSS (Grid Layout): For organizing the button layout and making the interface visually appealing.
JavaScript: To handle user inputs, perform calculations, and dynamically update the display.
Implementation Steps:

HTML Structure: Create the basic structure, including a display area and buttons for digits and operations.
CSS Styling: Use CSS Grid to align buttons and style the display for a user-friendly interface.
JavaScript Logic: Implement functions to capture button clicks, process mathematical operations, and handle edge cases like division by zero.
Testing and Debugging: Test the calculator’s functions, ensure error handling, and refine styling for a polished look.
Expected Outcome:

Upon completion, the project will yield a functional calculator with a responsive layout, enabling users to perform basic arithmetic calculations interactively. This project is an excellent exercise for those looking to strengthen their skills in web development and understand the essentials of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
